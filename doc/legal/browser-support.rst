Browser support
===============

Tested browsers
---------------

We develop pretalx to work with the following browsers:

- Apple Safari (macOS and iOS)
- Google Chrome (Android and Desktop)
- Microsoft Edge (Desktop)
- Mozilla Firefox (Android and Desktop)

We do not offer official support for other browsers such as Brave, Vivaldi, or Opera.
However, since these browsers use the same engines as Google Chrome, we expect them to work similarly.
We have **never** supported Internet Explorer.

Browser versions
-----------------

We officially support the **current stable release** of each of the browsers listed above.

This means we test pretalx with the latest versions of Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and Safari.
We do not actively test older browser versions, though they may continue to work.

Why only current versions?
---------------------------

pretalx is a small project with limited development resources.
Supporting multiple browser versions and ensuring compatibility with older releases would require significantly more testing effort and maintenance work.

By focusing on current browser versions, we can:

- Deliver new features faster
- Use modern web standards that improve performance and user experience
- Spend our limited resources on improving functionality rather than maintaining legacy compatibility

All major browsers update automatically these days, so the vast majority of users will have a current version.

Need broader browser support?
------------------------------

If you have specific requirements for supporting older browser versions or additional browsers, we're happy to discuss this as part of a **custom support contract**.
Please `get in touch with us <https://pretalx.com/p/about>`_ to discuss your needs and a support arrangement.
